## 01_08 Solution 1
This is an exercise file of the [SwiftData Essential Training](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/swiftdata-essential-training/persistence-in-swiftui-apps) course on LinkedIn Learning. 

I've stored the file as a `.zip` files for use as a **local** file. This has both beginning and the end states of the exercise app. It may also contain other resources you need for the project. 

Download the file for use on a **Local system**. It does not nor is intended to work in Github.  Decompress it, and use the files accordingly and to the directions of the video.
